# reinforcement-based-racetrack-learner
This project uses reinforcement learning to train an agent to navigate a racetrack and improve its lap times. The model learns through trial and error, optimizing actions such as acceleration and steering using Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN). The agent progressively reduces lap times by exploring the environment and adjusting its strategy.
