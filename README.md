# Reinforcement-Based Racetrack Learner

This repository contains a reinforcement learning-based solution where an agent learns to navigate a racetrack. The goal of the project is to develop a model that allows a car to autonomously learn how to drive along a track and improve its lap times through trial and error using reinforcement learning techniques.

## Key Features
- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm**: Utilizes Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to enable the car to make decisions and learn the best actions for optimal lap times.
- **Environment Simulation**: The racetrack is simulated using Python, and the car's actions, such as steering and acceleration, are optimized based on feedback from the environment.
- **Model Training**: The agent is trained in an iterative process, improving its strategy with each lap, gradually reducing its lap time as it discovers the most efficient route.
- **Performance Metrics**: The model's performance is evaluated by measuring lap time improvement and the agent's ability to avoid obstacles and maintain the optimal racing line.

## Technologies Used
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- **Python**: For implementation and simulation
